# Relay-Timer

While working on my automatic hydroponics system, I needed a timer to work my water pump for 10 minutes every 1 hour.
I saw various timer tutorials and found it difficult for a beginner like me to do. 
That is why my cousin and I used the delay() function to make it.

This code is designed to switch ON for 10 minutes and switch OFF for 50 minutes.

This can be changed using the following steps:
1. MINUTES: No. of minutes x 60 x 1000
2. SECONDS: No. of seconds x 1000
